# Speech2Speech

The Speech2Speech Python package is a Streamlit Web application that **models 
all phases of speech-to-speech translation**, including:
- recording speech in source language, 
- converting source language speech to text, 
- translating source language text to target language text, and 
- converting the translated text to speech in the target language. 

Each phase of the workflow creates a file, whose name is defined in the config.ini file. Advanced users can start or interrupt the workflow wherever they want by specifying their own files and adapting the config.ini file to refer to them. The user can also launch a specific phase of the workflow by clicking on the corresponding button.

Speech2Speech is designed to be accessible to a **broad audience**, including non-technical users. The package **does not require any specialized software training or user knowledge** and can be used straight out of the box. This makes it incredibly accessible to a wide range of users, including those with visual impairments who can input text by dictating it and have the package read documents aloud.

The package uses PyAudio, Open AI Whisper, Chat-GPT, and Google gttx and can automatically detect the source language used in speech. Users can, therefore, access accurate translations for a **wide range of languages** without having to switch between different translation tools. Although the quality of translation may vary depending on the target language, it is pretty good for popular languages such as English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Dutch and Italian.

Prerequisites
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before using Speech2Speech, you need to sign up for an OpenAI account, create an API key, and set up an environment variable. Here's how to do it:

1. **Signup and Create an OpenAI Account**: Go to the OpenAI website and 
   click on the "Sign up" button in the top right corner. Enter your name, email address, and password in the provided fields, and click on the "Sign up" button. Once you have signed up, you will be directed to the OpenAI dashboard.

2. **Create an OpenAI API Key**: Click on Personal at the right upper corner  and on the "View API Keys" tab in the OpenAI dashboard. Click on the "Create new secret key" button. Give your API key a name and select the type of API key you want to create (restricted or full). Once you have created your API key, copy it to your clipboard. Make sure to keep your API key secure, as it provides access to powerful computing resources and data.

3. **Create an Environment Variable to Load Your OpenAI API Key**:

   A. **Ubuntu (tested) and Mac (not yet tested)**
   
   Open your terminal. Type the following command to open your shell profile file:
      
         nano ~/.bashrc
      
   Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following line:
   
         export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
      
   Replace <YOUR_API_KEY> with the API key you created in the previous section. Save and close the file by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y, and then Enter. Type the following command to apply the changes:
         
         source ~/.bashrc
         
B. **Windows (not yet tested)**
   
   Right-click on the "Start" button and select "System".
   
   Click on "Advanced system settings".
   
   Click on "Environment Variables".
   
   Under "User variables", click on "New".
   
   Enter "OPENAI_API_KEY" in the "Variable name" field.
   
   Enter your API key in the "Variable value" field.
   
   Click on "OK" to save the changes.
   
   
Speech2Speech installation
--------------------------
To install Speech2Speech, open your terminal and run the following command:

    pip install speech2speech

Launch Speech2Speech
------------------------------------
To launch Speech2Speech, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the microphone and speakers of your device are on.

2. Navigate to the directory where your Speech2Speech program is located 
using the cd command.

3. Type the following command in the terminal to launch Speech2Speech:


   `streamlit run speech2speech.py`


Workflow
----------
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the full workflow of Speech2Speech:

1. Click the "Record Audio" button to start recording.
2. Begin speaking or reading aloud. As long as it supports it, Chat-GPT can 
   automatically detect the 
   language you're speaking, so there's no need to specify it.
3. Click the "Stop Recording" button to end the recording.
4. Click the "Transcribe" button to convert your speech into text. The 
   transcription will appear on a green background after a few seconds.
5. Select your desired target language from the dropdown menu under "Target 
   Language".
6. Click the "Translate" button to translate the transcription into your 
   chosen target language. The translated text will appear on a blue 
   background after a few seconds.
7. Click the "Read Translation" button to listen to the translated text.
8. If you want to repeat the process with a new dictation, click the "Refresh 
   Page" button to reset the page.
   
As indicated above, you can also use just parts of this full workflow by specifying the name(s) of the file(s) you want to use in the config.ini file and by clicking the relevant button of the user interface.

What to do if you encounter issues
-------------------------------

If Chat-GPT or speech2speech get stuck or you encounter any issues, simply click the "Refresh Page" button to reload the page with the default settings.
