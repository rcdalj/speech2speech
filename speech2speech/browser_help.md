1. Copy your OpenAI API key and paste it into the text box below the label 
   "OpenAI API Key". The key you enter will not be visible on 
   the screen by default.
2. Click the "Record Audio" button to start recording.
3. Begin speaking or reading aloud. When your dictation is finished, press 
   CTRL+E to stop recording it. Chat-GPT can 
   automatically detect the 
   language you're speaking (as long as it also supports it), so there's no 
   need to specify it.
4. Click the "Transcribe" button to convert your dictation into text.
5. Select your desired target language from the dropdown menu under "Target 
   Language".
6. Click the "Translate" button to translate the transcription into your 
   chosen target language. The translated text will appear on a blue 
   background after a few seconds.
7. Click the "Read Translation" button to listen to the translated text.
8. If you want to repeat the process with a new dictation, click the "Refresh 
   Page" button to reset the page.
